_A growing repository for local LLM inference with minimal dependencies maintained by aozsen._

# School42 Local AI Chat Interface 🎓💻

**Purpose:** Minimal codebase demonstrating how to interact with local Large Language Models using Ollama and the OpenAI API. Designed for collaborative learning by students at **School 42**. This project intentionally keeps dependencies low so new contributors can run it on any machine or container without complex setup.

## Prerequisites
1. A Linux environment (Ubuntu) — typical of our labs
2. python >= 3.13.5

### Install Dependencies
```bash 
make install
```

## Usage
```bash 
make run # creates virtual environment (.venv) and installs dependencies if necessary.
```

**Setting up environment variables**

The project reads runtime configuration from a `.env` file (or the environment). An example is provided in `.env.example`.

To create a `.env` from the example and edit it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env and set PROVIDER and OPENAI_API as needed
```

After creating `.env`, run:

```bash
make run
```

## Contributing Guidelines 🤝  

This project lives at School 42, where peer-to-peer teaching and code sharing are core values. Before contributing:
1. Fork this repository first using GitHub's [Fork & Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) flow  
2. Follow the `.gitignore` rules — never commit secrets or local env files (`.env`) to main branch

If you want to add new functionality, write a clear PR title describing what changes do and why they help other students learn more efficiently.
